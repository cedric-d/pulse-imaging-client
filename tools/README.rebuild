The Pulse 2 imaging project come from the LRS imaging modules, which is
a *really* old project.

Most of the code here was written between 2001 and 2003, using libs from
those time, and not effort has been done to use newer libs.

In the "3rd party" folder, you will find archives of the reiserfs prog
suite. The furnished archive contains a patched version made by Linbox 
which can only be built on a pre glibc 2.1 system. An additional
patch is provided to allow build on modern system.
