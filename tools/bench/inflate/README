How to use the tests

In order to benchmark inflate(), data files are needed.

For examples, take some disk content with 

dd if=/dev/sdaX of=data.disk bs=4096 count=$((1024 * 16))

Then compress it with the zpipe tools from
http://www.zlib.net/zlib_how.html

cat data.disk | ./zpipe > data.disk.zz

Then you can start multiples tests, for example.

for insize in 2048 8192 65536 262144 524288 ; do
 for outsize in 2048 8192 65536 262144 524288 ; do
  ./bench-inflate       $insize $outsize data.disk.zz  > values_$insize_$outsize.csv
  ./bench-inflate-zpipe $insize $outsize data.disk.zz  > values-zpipe_$insize_$outsize.csv
 done
done


Once run, process the .CSV file with a spreadsheet to found the optimal
algorithm and buffers sizes suitable for your data.

If run as root, the tool try to get realtime priority: it will be able
to run at full speed, but for some loop iteration it will be slower, 
so you have to remove all values too much above the average.
You should use the standard deviation ("Ã©cart type") to help you
choose which values are really above the normal.
