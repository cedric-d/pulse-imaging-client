posix_{f,m}advise() benchmark
=============================

Use posix_fadvise() on file
Use posix_madvise() on memory mapped file.

functions posix_{f,m}advise() allow the program to give hints about file
usage by the program.

In theory, memory mapped should be faster since it's require less
memory operation : no need for the kernel to copy data to/from a
userspace buffer. But disk latency/throughput seems to be the main
bottleneck, so this doesn't really help to use mmap(). In fact, the
code to use mmap() is overcomplicated, so it's probably not a way to
go.

The benchmark tests only read operation. Write operations should be
tested, especially calling DONTNEED would probably requires msync()
and/or fsync()/fdatasync() before, otherwise, the content could be
discarded and the destination not updated.
