Please note that this theme uses Linbox brand and the Linbox logo which
are subject to trademark law, and that trademark law is not copyright law.
The "Linbox" trademark is a trademark of Linbox Free&Alter soft SARL,
in France and other countries and is used by permission.

If a user modifies the Software, then the user must replace all images
containing the "Linbox" trademark, such as logo_linux_vga16.ppm in the current
directory.

Linbox FAS grants you the right to use the logo as is, without any
modification for the sole use within Webmin. The logo ("penguin box" and
Linbox name) may not be modified in any ways without a prior written
agreement of Linbox FAS SARL.

It is not incompatible with the GPL since the logo files are not part
of the program itself, they are simply data used by that program, and
changing the logo data has absolutely no effect on the functional use
of the program.
